- *Status*: Working correctly

## Backend Deployment via Friend's Railway Account

### Steps for Your Friend:
1. Fork the repository to their GitHub account
2. Sign up/log in to Railway.app (using their account)
3. Create a new project on Railway
4. Connect their GitHub account to Railway
5. Select the forked repository
6. Railway will automatically detect the `railway.json` configuration
7. Add environment variables in Railway:
   ```
   FRONTEND_URL=https://legalklarity.netlify.app
   PORT=8080
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key  # Optional - can leave empty for mock mode
   USE_MOCK_API=true  # Set to false when you have real API keys
   ```
   
   For Firebase integration, they'll also need:
   ```
   # Firebase service account (as JSON string)
   FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={"type":"service_account",...}
   ```

### After Deployment:
1. Your friend will get a URL like `https://legalklarity-production.up.railway.app`
2. Share this URL with you
3. You will update Netlify environment variables:
   
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-friend-railway-url.up.railway.app
   ```
   
4. Trigger a new deploy on Netlify
